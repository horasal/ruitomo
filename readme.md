First, you need 'Go-SDL', then simply run `go build ruitomo.go` and run `ruitomo`.

To start your game, you should put all the resources, including bgms, voices and scripts, into `./data`. 
Program will start from `start.tjs`. Please notices that scripts written under windows may ingore the cases of filename.
